   A WalkFile is a special case of File.  It is produced when walking a
   directory structure, see DirectoryWalk.Callback.  The TSK_FS_FILE*
   objects produced by e.g. tsk_fs_dir_walk are short-lived, they do
   NOT live past the callback.  Also, they are closed by
   tsk_fs_dir_walk.

   So in order to 'grab' a File object for later use outside the
   callback loop, we have this bridge class, the WalkFile.  Like a
   TSK_FS_FILE, its lifetime is restricted to a callback
   (DirectoryWalk.Callback), but a Proxy for it can be retrieved
   during that time.

   The Proxy classes, NameProxy and MetaProxy, preserve enough info
   from the WalkFile so that the 'real' File can be later opened.  If
   you later need a full path to the open file, use the NameProxy.  If
   you just need its meta address, use the MetaProxy.

   Here's how to use WalkFiles and Proxies while walking a FileSystem:

   final List<Proxy> ps = new ArrayList<Proxy>();
   DirectoryWalk.Callback w = new DirectoryWalk.Callback() {
     public int apply( WalkFile f, String path ) {
					Proxy p = f.metaProxy();
					ps.add( p );
					return Walk.WALK_CONT;
				}
			};
  int flags = DirectoryWalk.FLAG_ALLOC | DirectoryWalk.FLAG_RECURSE;
  fs.dirWalk( fs.rootINum(), flags, w );

  // walk completed. Now revisit the Proxies to locate the Files we want.
  for( Proxy p : ps ) {
	  File f = p.openFile();
	  System.out.println( f.meta().addr() );
  }
*/

public class WalkFile extends File {

	/**
	 * Called only by native code: filesystem.c
	 */
	WalkFile( long nativePtr, FileSystem fs, Meta meta, Name name ) {
		super( nativePtr, fs, meta, name );
	}

	/**
	 *  We do NOT close the nativePtr, since the C walk code does that...
	 */
	@Override
	protected void closeImpl() {
	}

	public Proxy nameProxy( String path ) {
		// LOOK: This cannot be right ??
		return null;
	}

	public Proxy metaProxy() {
		return new MetaProxy( fs, meta.addr() );
	}

}

// eof
