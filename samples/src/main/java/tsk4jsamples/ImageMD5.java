   Open an image supplied in args[0]. e.g. /dev/sda or a disk image
   file like foo.dd. Read the content and feed that content through an
   MD5 derivation scheme.

   Obviously you get the same result, and without any programming, via
   a simple command line invocation:

   $ md5sum /dev/sda

   The point here is just give a flavor of tsk4j's Image and Utils
   classes, and particulary how Image supports access to its data via
   the familiar java.io.InputStream.
